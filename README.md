# Rent-a-Car-Project
Group project for a car rental website.

Our goal is to create a basic web application to manage car rentals, allowing users to view available cars, rent them, and see rental details.

We'll use JavaScript arrays of objects to represent our data.

The main page will display all available cars of our rental service. Also our group will also add a filter function to render a easier search function. And lastly, we will add a calculator to identify the cost of each car for rent.
